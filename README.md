This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation
With the rise in popularity of r/WallStreetBets and the whole saga surrounding GME stocks, many people are getting into the stock market. As such, my friend and I would like a simulation of the stock market where we can buy and sell stocks, without using real money or affecting the real stock market. This web app will simulate the stock market and allow users to execute trades. Moreover, this platform will allow users to interact with their friends on the platform to allow for communication and peer learning.


## Aim
We hope to make a web app that allows our users to experience building their own portfolios and experience investing. Moreover, users can share their portfolios with others and interact so as to learn and understand each otherâ€™s perspective that will allow them to form more informed decisions when they are investing. Ultimately, we wish to give them a social platform to experience investing and share their progress and updates with their friends as they undergo their investing journey on the platform.


## Proposed Level of Achievement:
Orbital 2022 Apollo 11 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
